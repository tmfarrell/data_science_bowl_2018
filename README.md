Applies [Mask-RCNN](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN), a regional convolutional 
neural network (RCNN) for instance segmentation published in March 2017, the automated nuclei
detection problem posed by the data science bowl 2018. See [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018) for the Kaggle competition. 

See [this clip](https://youtu.be/nDPWywWRIRo?t=4052) for an introduction to Mask-RCNN. Read more 
about the model in their [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870).
