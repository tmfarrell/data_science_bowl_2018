# data science bowl 2018

Applies [Mask-RCNN](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) (a regional convolutional 
neural network for instance segmentation, published in March 2017) to the automated nuclei
detection problem posed by the [data science bowl 2018](https://datasciencebowl.com/). 
See [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018) for the Kaggle competition. 

See [this clip](https://youtu.be/nDPWywWRIRo?t=4052) for an introduction to Mask-RCNN. Read more 
about the model in their [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870).
